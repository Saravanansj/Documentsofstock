# Stock Price Prediction

## Introduction

This code is designed to build a predictive model for determining whether to buy or not buy Microsoft stock based on historical stock price data. It encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The code employs various machine learning algorithms and focuses on ROC AUC as the primary evaluation metric.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Usage

1. *Data Preparation*: Ensure you have historical Microsoft stock price data in a CSV file, and specify the file path in the code.
2. *Environment Setup*: Make sure you have the required libraries installed. If not, install them using pip.
3. *Running the Code*: Execute the code to preprocess the data, engineer features, train three machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Code Structure

- *Data Preprocessing*: Loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset.
- *Feature Engineering*: Creating new features, handling dates, and defining the target variable.
- *Model Training*: Training Logistic Regression, SVC, and XGBoost Classifier models.
- *Model Evaluation*: Assessing model performance using ROC AUC and a confusion matrix.
- *Recommendations*: Providing suggestions for further improvement and real-world deployment.
- *Dataset*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/microsoft-lifetime-stocks-dataset

## Recommendations and Conclusions

The README concludes by emphasizing the importance of more comprehensive model evaluation, addressing class imbalance, exploring advanced techniques, considering real-world deployment factors, and enabling continuous model monitoring. The code is a starting point, and its full potential can be realized with these enhancements.
